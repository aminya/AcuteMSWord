# Amin MSWord VBA macros

My Microsoft Word VBA macros.

# MathType2Word
Convert Mathtype Equations to Microsoft Word Equations.

This is similar to what [GrindEQ](https://www.grindeq.com/index.php?p=mathtype2equation), which is a commercial software does.

It converts both inline and full equations

Usage:

* Select the part of the document you want to convert its equations.
* Then run the macro.

To do: It has an issue which puts `[]` around full equations. [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57032924/select-the-result-of-replacement-word-macro)

# codePaste

# pasteSelected
